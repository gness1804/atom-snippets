This is a handy list of snippets, or code shortcuts, for use in the Atom text editor. The snippets.cson file contains all of these snippets, which are written in CoffeeScript (.cson). They can be used to insert bits of code that one is likely to write repeatedly, this saving time. The snippets can be customized within each user's snippets.cson file.

For each snippet, the 'prefix' represents what one types in Atom to trigger a green arrow which can be clicked on or activated with the tab key to place the snippet into the document. For more details on Atom snippets, see [Atom guide to snippets] (http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/snippets/)

Happy coding,
